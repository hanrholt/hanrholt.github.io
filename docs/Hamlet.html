			<p class="verseline">So frown’d he once when, in an angry parle, </p>
			<p class="verseline">He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis strange. </p>
			<p class="character">Marcellus </p>
			<p class="verseline">Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, </p>
			<p class="verseline">With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch. </p>
			<p class="character">Horatio </p>
			<p class="verseline">In what particular thought to work I know not; </p>
			<p class="verseline">But, in the gross and scope of my opinion, </p>
			<p class="verseline">This bodes some strange eruption to our state. </p>
			<p class="character">Marcellus </p>
			<p class="verseline">Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why this same strict and most observant watch </p>
			<p class="verseline">So nightly toils the subject of the land, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And why such daily cast of brazen cannon </p>
			<p class="verseline">And foreign mart for implements of war; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task </p>
			<p class="verseline">Does not divide the Sunday from the week. </p>
			<p class="verseline">What might be toward, that this sweaty haste </p>
			<p class="verseline">Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day? </p>
			<p class="verseline">Who is’t that can inform me? </p>
			<p class="character">Horatio </p>
			<p class="verseline">That can I. </p>
			<p class="verseline">At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Whose image even but now appear’d to us, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Thereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Dar’d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet </p>
			<p class="verseline">(For so this side of our known world esteem’d him) </p>
			<p class="verseline">Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal’d compact, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Well ratified by law and heraldry, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands </p>
			<p class="verseline">Which he stood seiz’d of, to the conqueror; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Against the which a moiety competent </p>
			<p class="verseline">Was gaged by our king; which had return’d </p>
			<p class="verseline">To the inheritance of Fortinbras, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart </p>
			<p class="verseline">And carriage of the article design’d, </p>
			<p class="verseline">His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of unimproved mettle hot and full, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Shark’d up a list of lawless resolutes, </p>
			<p class="verseline">For food and diet, to some enterprise </p>
			<p class="verseline">That hath a stomach in’t; which is no other, </p>
			<p class="verseline">As it doth well appear unto our state, </p>
			<p class="verseline">But to recover of us, by strong hand </p>
			<p class="verseline">And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands </p>

			<p class="verseline">The virtue of his will; but you must fear, </p>

			<p class="verseline">For he himself is subject to his birth. </p>

			<p class="verseline">Carve for himself, for on his choice depends </p>
			<p class="verseline">The safety and health of this whole state, </p>

			<p class="verseline">I am thy father’s spirit, </p>

			<p class="verseline">Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature </p>

			<p class="verseline">If thou didst ever thy dear father love- </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="verseline">O God! </p>
			<p class="character">Ghost </p>
			<p class="verseline">Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="verseline">Murther? </p>

			<p class="verseline">Haste me to know’t, that I, with wings as swift </p>

			<p class="verseline">Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear. </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, </p>
			<p class="verseline">A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is by a forged process of my death </p>
			<p class="verseline">Rankly abus’d. But know, thou noble youth, </p>
			<p class="verseline">The serpent that did sting thy father’s life </p>

			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="verseline">O my prophetic soul! </p>
			<p class="verseline">My uncle? </p>
			<p class="character">Ghost </p>
			<p class="verseline">Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, </p>
			<p class="verseline">With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts- </p>
			<p class="verseline">O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power </p>
			<p class="verseline">So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust </p>
			<p class="verseline">The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen. </p>
			<p class="verseline">O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there, </p>
			<p class="verseline">From me, whose love was of that dignity </p>
			<p class="verseline">That it went hand in hand even with the vow </p>
			<p class="verseline">I made to her in marriage, and to decline </p>
			<p class="verseline">Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor </p>
			<p class="verseline">To those of mine! </p>
			<p class="verseline">But virtue, as it never will be mov’d, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, </p>
			<p class="verseline">So lust, though to a radiant angel link’d, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Will sate itself in a celestial bed </p>

			<p class="verseline">But soft! methinks I scent the morning air. </p>
			<p class="verseline">Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, </p>
			<p class="verseline">My custom always of the afternoon, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, </p>
			<p class="verseline">With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, </p>

			<p class="verseline">The leperous distilment; whose effect </p>
			<p class="verseline">Holds such an enmity with blood of man </p>
			<p class="verseline">That swift as quicksilverr it courses through </p>
			<p class="verseline">The natural gates and alleys of the body, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And with a sudden vigour it doth posset </p>
			<p class="verseline">And curd, like eager droppings into milk, </p>
			<p class="verseline">The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And a most instant tetter bark’d about, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust </p>
			<p class="verseline">All my smooth body. </p>
			<p class="verseline">Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch’d; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Unhous’led, disappointed, unanel’d, </p>

			<p class="prose">A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o’ th’ worst. </p>
			<p class="character">Rosencrantz </p>
			<p class="prose">We think not so, my lord. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">Why, then ‘tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison. </p>
			<p class="character">Rosencrantz </p>
			<p class="prose">Why, then your ambition makes it one. ‘Tis too narrow for your mind. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams. </p>
			<p class="character">Guildenstern </p>
			<p class="prose">Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">A dream itself is but a shadow. </p>
			<p class="character">Rosencrantz </p>
			<p class="prose">Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch’d heroes the beggars’ shadows. Shall we to th’ court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason. </p>
			<p class="character">Both </p>
			<p class="prose">We’ll wait upon you. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore? </p>
			<p class="character">Rosencrantz </p>
			<p class="prose">To visit you, my lord; no other occasion. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you; and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak. </p>
			<p class="character">Guildenstern </p>
			<p class="prose">What should we say, my lord? </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">Why, anything- but to th’ purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen have sent for you. </p>
			<p class="character">Rosencrantz </p>
			<p class="prose">To what end, my lord? </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for or no. </p>
			<p class="character">Rosencrantz </p>
			<p class="prose"><span class="stage_directions_inline">[aside to Guildenstern]</span> What say you? </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose"><span class="stage_directions_inline">[aside]</span> Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold not off. </p>
			<p class="character">Guildenstern </p>
			<p class="prose">My lord, we were sent for. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so. </p>
			<p class="character">Rosencrantz </p>
			<p class="prose">My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">Why did you laugh then, when I said ‘Man delights not me’? </p>
			<p class="character">Rosencrantz </p>
			<p class="prose">To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o’ th’ sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt fort. What players are they? </p>
			<p class="character">Rosencrantz </p>
			<p class="prose">Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the tragedians of the city. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways. </p>
			<p class="character">Rosencrantz </p>
			<p class="prose">I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so follow’d? </p>
			<p class="character">Rosencrantz </p>
			<p class="prose">No indeed are they not. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">How comes it? Do they grow rusty? </p>
			<p class="character">Rosencrantz </p>
			<p class="prose">Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapp’d fort. These are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and dare scarce come thither. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">What, are they children? Who maintains ‘em? How are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession. </p>
			<p class="character">Rosencrantz </p>
			<p class="prose">Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for a while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">Is’t possible? </p>
			<p class="character">Guildenstern </p>
			<p class="prose">O, there has been much throwing about of brains. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">Do the boys carry it away? </p>
			<p class="character">Rosencrantz </p>
			<p class="prose">Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little. ‘Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out. </p>

			<p class="character">Guildenstern </p>
			<p class="prose">There are the players. </p>

Let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome.

			<p class="character">Polonius </p>
			<p class="prose">My lord, I have news to tell you. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome- </p>
			<p class="character">Polonius </p>
			<p class="prose">The actors are come hither, my lord. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">Buzz, buzz! </p>
			<p class="character">Polonius </p>
			<p class="prose">Upon my honour- </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">Then came each actor on his ass- </p>
			<p class="character">Polonius </p>
			<p class="prose">The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men. </p>

			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter four or five Players. </h2>
			<p class="prose">You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see thee well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy face is valanc’d since I saw thee last. Com’st’ thou to’ beard me in Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By’r Lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not crack’d within the ring.- Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to’t like French falconers, fly at anything we see. We’ll have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech. </p>
			<p class="character">First Player. </p>
			<p class="prose">What speech, my good lord? </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted; or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas’d not the million, ‘twas caviary to the general; but it was (as I receiv’d it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation; but call’d it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in’t I chiefly lov’d. ‘Twas AEneas’ tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see: </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast-’ </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus: </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Black as his purpose, did the night resemble </p>
			<p class="verseline">When he lay couched in the ominous horse, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Hath now this dread and black complexion smear’d </p>
			<p class="verseline">With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot </p>
			<p class="verseline">Now is be total gules, horridly trick’d </p>
			<p class="verseline">With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Bak’d and impasted with the parching streets, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That lend a tyrannous and a damned light </p>
			<p class="verseline">To their lord’s murther. Roasted in wrath and fire, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And thus o’ersized with coagulate gore, </p>
			<p class="verseline">With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus </p>
			<p class="verseline">Old grandsire Priam seeks.’ </p>
			<p class="verseline">So, proceed you. </p>
			<p class="character">Polonius </p>
			<p class="prose">Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion. </p>
			<p class="character">First Player. </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Anon he finds him, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Repugnant to command. Unequal match’d, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide; </p>
			<p class="verseline">But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword </p>
			<p class="verseline">Th’ unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top </p>
			<p class="verseline">Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash </p>
			<p class="verseline">Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear. For lo! his sword, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Which was declining on the milky head </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of reverend Priam, seem’d i’ th’ air to stick. </p>
			<p class="verseline">So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And, like a neutral to his will and matter, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Did nothing. </p>
			<p class="verseline">But, as we often see, against some storm, </p>
			<p class="verseline">A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still, </p>
			<p class="verseline">The bold winds speechless, and the orb below </p>
			<p class="verseline">As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder </p>
			<p class="verseline">Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus’ pause, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Aroused vengeance sets him new awork; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall </p>
			<p class="verseline">On Mars’s armour, forg’d for proof eterne, </p>
			<p class="verseline">With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword </p>
			<p class="verseline">Now falls on Priam. </p>
			<p class="verseline">Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods, </p>
			<p class="verseline">In general synod take away her power; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel, </p>

			<p class="prose">Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow’d? Do you hear? Let them be well us’d; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live. </p>

			<p class="verseline">To be, or not to be- that is the question: </p>
			<p class="verseline">Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer </p>
			<p class="verseline">The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune </p>
			<p class="verseline">Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep- </p>
			<p class="verseline">No more; and by a sleep to say we end </p>
			<p class="verseline">The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks </p>
			<p class="verseline">That flesh is heir to. ‘Tis a consummation </p>
			<p class="verseline">Devoutly to be wish’d. To die- to sleep. </p>
			<p class="verseline">To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub! </p>
			<p class="verseline">For in that sleep of death what dreams may come </p>
			<p class="verseline">When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Must give us pause. There’s the respect </p>
			<p class="verseline">That makes calamity of so long life. </p>
			<p class="verseline">For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, </p>
			<p class="verseline">The pangs of despis’d love, the law’s delay, </p>
			<p class="verseline">The insolence of office, and the spurns </p>
			<p class="verseline">That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes, </p>
			<p class="verseline">When he himself might his quietus make </p>
			<p class="verseline">With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear, </p>
			<p class="verseline">To grunt and sweat under a weary life, </p>
			<p class="verseline">But that the dread of something after death- </p>
			<p class="verseline">The undiscover’d country, from whose bourn </p>
			<p class="verseline">No traveller returns- puzzles the will, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And makes us rather bear those ills we have </p>
			<p class="verseline">Than fly to others that we know not of? </p>
			<p class="verseline">Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And thus the native hue of resolution </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And enterprises of great pith and moment </p>
			<p class="verseline">With this regard their currents turn awry </p>
			<p class="verseline">And lose the name of action.- Soft you now! </p>
			<p class="verseline">The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons </p>
			<p class="verseline">Be all my sins rememb’red. </p>

			<p class="character">Ophelia </p>
			<p class="prose">Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty? </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once. </p>
			<p class="character">Ophelia </p>
			<p class="prose">Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so. </p>

			<p class="prose">Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me, I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where’s your father? </p>

			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too. </p>
			<p class="prose">Farewell. </p>

			<p class="prose">O heavenly powers, restore him! </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you amble, and you lisp; you nickname God’s creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I’ll no more on’t! it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no moe marriages.

			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc’d it to you, trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp’d for o’erdoing Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it. </p>
			<p class="character">Player </p>
			<p class="prose">I warrant your honour. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as ‘twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o’erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature’s journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably. </p>
			<p class="character">Player </p>
			<p class="prose">I hope we have reform’d that indifferently with us, sir. </p>
			<p class="character">Hamlet </p>
			<p class="prose">O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered.

Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper’s ears, and leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate action.
